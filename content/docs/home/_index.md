## Hey!
I'm Ritarka (Rit-are-ka).

I am a first year Master's student at Carnegie Mellon studying Artificial Intelligence.

I'm interested in a lot of things and don't quite know what I want to do for a career. I have had a good bit of experience working with embedded systems, computer architecture, and firmware. I liked that, but am always looking to experiment and try out new things.

I primarily use C/C++ and Python.

Favorite Data Structure: Hash Map  
Favorite Algorithm: LSD Radix Sort
