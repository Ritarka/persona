# Embedded Wordle

I did this project as part of my ECE 2035 [HW/SW Design Class]({{< relref "/docs/Coursework/embedded.md">}})

I used an Mbed, LCD screen, buttons, and gyroscope to create this embedded version of wordle. I even expanded the game to include a leaderboard, levels, and animations.

Not too difficult, and I especially enjoyed pushing the hardware to its limits while developing the software.

Somehow I lost the video :thinking: but luckily a friend still had a picture. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/Ritarka/Mberdle).
