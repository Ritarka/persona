# Algorithms

This included two classes, CS 1332 (Data Structures and Algorithms) and CS 3510 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms).


## Data Structures and Algorithms

This was quite an interesting class, and I learned about all the basic data structrures like *queues, stacks, heaps, AVLs, hash maps,* and more; along with common sorting and graph algorithms.

The class centered around learning about some concept and immediately implementing it as a homework in Java. The [csvistool](https://csvistool.com/) is absolutely amazing in helping visualize the concepts we learned and contains a good summary of all that I learned in the class.

**Favourite Data Structure:** Hash Map  
**Favourite Algorithm:** LSD Radix Sort

## Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Just when I thought I could not enjoy DS&A more, I was presented with this class. This course took a more abstract view on algorithms and focused on the problem solving and mathematical aspects of algorithms.

We tackled *divide and conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming,* and also learned about *NP Completeness*. The homeworks involved simply describing how one would solve a problem and perhaps writing some pseudo-code, and as such, this class really tested my communication and problem solving skills rather than rote programming.
