# Embedded Systems

I took a few courses on this topic, but never felt this to be too difficult. My experince in this has been limited to microcontrollers, breadboarded circuits, and the ocassional FPGA.

For this reason, things followed a pretty set pattern:
1. Read the datasheet
2. Wire up hardware
3. Write code
4. Profit

Working with FPGAs and microcontrollers does have the benefit of being more demonstrable than others. The joys of dynamic programming might be lost on your grandmother, everyone understands blinking LEDs.
