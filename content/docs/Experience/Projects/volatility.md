# Volatility Viewer

This was created as part of a hackathon in late October 2022. This was my first Foray into anything data-science and web app related, and I reallu enjoyed it.

We created a web app that would attempt to explain or predict economic volatility (measured by the VIX) through indices such as the federal funds rate, S&P 500, and mortgage rates. I was involved in the story creation aspect. I simply gathered all sorts of data and tried to find strong relationships to volatility.
